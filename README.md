# NFL Slit Film Turf Analysis Data and Code
Data and code for the paper "Association of Slit-Film and Other Artificial Turf with Lower Extremity Injuries Among National Football League Players, 2018-23"

The main analysis code file is Turf_Manuscript_0625.R

The main data file is model_data_final.csv. It contains data on the surface for each NFL regular season game from 2018-23 and a count of lower extremity injuries in each game, among other variables. A data dictionary is forthcoming, but the analysis code file will give you an idea of what certain variables mean.

The first ~140 lines of the analysis code load packages (necessary to run) and import our raw data to create the clean main data file listed above (do not need to be run). The remainder conducts our analysis.

If you would like to request the raw data, some of which is commercially protected, please email Dr. Binney at zbinney at emory dot edu.
